1.Pig script find the average age of male and female persons died in the titanic tragedy

titanic = load '/user/acadgild/titanicdata.txt' using PigStorage(',') as 
(Passengerid:int, Survived:int, Pclass:int, Name, Sex:chararray, Age:int, Sibsp:int, Parch:int, Ticket:chararray, Fare:float, Cabin:chararray, Embarked:chararray);

dead = filter titanic by Survived == 1;

male = filter dead by Sex == 'male';

female = filter dead by Sex == 'female';

grp_male = group male all;

grp_female = group female all;

o_male = foreach grp_male generate AVG(male.Age);

o_female = foreach grp_female generate AVG(female.Age);

dump o_male;  

dump o_female;


2. Pig script to find the number of people died and survived in each class.


titanic = load '/user/acadgild/titanicdata.txt' using PigStorage(',') as 
(Passengerid:int,Survived:int, Pclass:int, Name, Sex:chararray, Age:int, Sibsp:int, Parch:int, Ticket:chararray, Fare:float, Cabin:chararray, Embarked:chararray);


dead = filter titanic by Survived == 0;
alive = filter titanic by Survived == 1;

grp_dead = group dead by Pclass;

grp_alive = group alive by Pclass;

o_dead = foreach grp_dead generate COUNT(dead);

o_alive = foreach grp_alive generate COUNT(surv);

dump o_dead;  

dump o_alive;
